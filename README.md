# Dummy-Elevator

A program that emulates an elevator.

Features:
- 25 floors that users can go to.
- The elevator will only move once it is full(10 passengers) and will not take anymore passengers on the way.
- Once the 10 passengers has exited the elevator it will be now available to accommodate 10 passengers again.
- Shows passenger log which contains records of past passengers names and which floor they exited including the user (only on runtime).
- Users can go in to the elevator with other people with them by inputting their name/s and floor/s.
- If the capacity(10) of the elevator is not met the program will automatically fill the elevator with passengers from a pre-defined list and will assign them with random floors that they will exit on.
