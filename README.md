# Elevator-Simulator-with-Passenger-Log 

The "Elevator Simulator with Passenger Log" program simulates the operation of an elevator system. Users can input their name, select a floor destination within a range of 1 to 25, and optionally indicate if they have accompanying passengers. The program tracks each passenger's journey and logs it, displaying the log upon request. It handles scenarios where the elevator operates with or without additional passengers, ensuring a simulated experience of elevator usage in a building setting. This simulation helps understand elevator dynamics and passenger interactions in a controlled environment.

Features:

- 25 floors that users can go to.
- The elevator will only move once it reached its capacity (10 passengers) and will not take any more passengers on the way.
- Once the 10 passengers have exited the elevator, it will be available to accommodate 10 passengers again.
- Shows passenger log, which contains records of past passenger's names and which floor they exited including the user (only on runtime).
- Users can go into the elevator with other people by inputting their name/s and floor/s.
- If the capacity(10) of the elevator is not met, the program will automatically fill the elevator with passengers from a pre-defined
list and will assign them with random floors that they will exit on.
