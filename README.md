# Dummy-Elevator

A program that emulates an elevator.

Features:

- 25 floors that users can go to.
- The elevator will only move once it reached its capacity (10 passengers) and will not take any more passengers on the way.
- Once the 10 passengers have exited the elevator, it will be available to accommodate 10 passengers again.
- Shows passenger log, which contains records of past passenger's names and which floor they exited including the user (only on runtime).
- Users can go into the elevator with other people by inputting their name/s and floor/s.
- If the capacity(10) of the elevator is not met, the program will automatically fill the elevator with passengers from a pre-defined
list and will assign them with random floors that they will exit on.
